# Hands-On Lattice and Longitudinal Calculations - Python version
*D. Gamba, A. Latina, A. Poyet, G. Sterbini, V. Ziemann*

During the [CAS 2022 in Kaunas](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1117526/) (Lithuania), we will be using Python or MATLAB as scripting languages for the Hands-On Lattice Calculation course.

This [repository](https://github.com/dgamba/CAS_2022) contains all material used during the **python** version of the course.
The repository is based on the material prepared and updated during previous courses by *G. Sterbini, A. Latina, A. Poyet,* CERN and *V. Ziemann,* Uppsala University.

- [Setup_Instructions.md](./Setup_Instructions.md) contains all information to get ready for the course. We kindly ask the student to read this document **before coming** to CAS to **prepare yourself** (and **your laptop**) for the course. 
- [CAS_Optics_Primer.pdf](./CAS_Optics_Primer.pdf) is the primer of the course. You are invited to consult it before, during, and after the course. 
- [Exercises.ipynb](./Exercises.ipynb) will be the "canvas" used during the course. It contains all exercise with "incomplete" parts that the student will have to fill.
- [Exercises_Solutions.ipynb](./Exercises_Solutions.ipynb) contains the solutions to all the exercises that we will tackle during the course. This notebook is provided for the student convenience, but it is clearly not expected to be used before and/or during the course itself.

**NOTE:** the material in this repository is expected to evolve over time thanks to the feedback received from you! Please don't hesitate to transmit us your comments, suggestions, and complains!
